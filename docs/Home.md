# Welcome

Welcome to the Brim wiki. These pages provide additional information for your
effective use of the Brim desktop application and related tools.

> **Note:** In Brim release `v0.25.0` and newer, functionality related to
> pcap processing (including the generation of Zeek and Suricata summary logs
> from pcaps and pcap import/extraction workflows) is now handled by
> [Brimcap](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap), which is bundled with Brim.
> A separate [Brimcap wiki](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap/wiki)
> contains current docs related to pcap processing.
