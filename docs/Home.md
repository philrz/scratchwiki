# Welcome

Welcome to the Brim wiki. These pages provide additional information for your
effective use of the Brim desktop application and related tools.

> **Note:** In Brim release `v0.25.0` and newer, functionality related to
> pcap processing (including the generation of Zeek and Suricata summary logs
> from pcaps) is now handled by [Brimcap](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap).
> Brimcap is bundled with Brim to provide a pcap import/extraction workflow
> similar to what was present in Brim versions `v0.24.0` and older. A separate
> [Brimcap wiki](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap/wiki) exists that contains
> current docs related to pcap processing.
