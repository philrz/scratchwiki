# Linux RPM Upgrade (v0.25.0 and newer)

GA Brim release `v0.25.0` uses a new toolkit for packaging and installing the
app. The [RPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) packages
for this newer installer are unfortunately incompatible with the RPM packages
from the older system, such that an attempt to install RPM packages of Brim
`v0.25.0` (or newer) while an installation of Brim `v0.24.0` (or older) is
still present results in a failure similar to the one shown below.

To resolve the issue, simply uninstall the prior Brim release (e.g., by
executing `yum remove brim` or `dnf remove brim` in your shell) before
re-attempting the install of the new release. All previously-imported data and
app settings (which are stored below the [user data](https://github.com/philrz/scratchwiki/wiki/Filesystem-Paths#user-data-all-versions)
path, separate from the [application binaries](https://github.com/philrz/scratchwiki/wiki/Filesystem-Paths#application-binaries-v0250))
will still be intact when you now proceed with the install of the newer release.

This is a one-time procedure. Once you successfully install the newer Brim
release, upgrading via RPM packages to future releases newer than `v0.25.0`
will not require this manual uninstall step.

> **Note:** The procedure described above is _only_ required for Linux
> distributions that use the RPM package format. On distributions that
> use [DEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)) packaging you
> should be able to install the new `v0.25.0` release while the older Brim is
> still present, replacing the older release.
