   * Linux users of RPM packages (such as for Red Hat-style distributions) will
     need to uninstall the older `v0.24.0` release before the RPM package for
     `v0.25.0` will successfully install. See the 
     [Linux RPM Upgrade](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/blob/v0.25.0/docs/Linux-RPM-Upgrade-%28v0.25.0%2B%29.md)
     article in the Brim wiki for details.
